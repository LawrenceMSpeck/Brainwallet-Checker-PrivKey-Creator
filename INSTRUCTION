INSTRUCTION BRAIN-WALLET GENERATOR:
Linux & Windows

!!ATTENTION!! This tool is for training purposes only.

Most of the tools you find on YouTube or the Internet are rubbish or infected with viruses, they want to steal 
from someone.

That's why I wrote a tool that you can use to check so-called brain wallets. The tool searches various words, 
generates a private key and the wallet address from them, and with the API it also checks the balance on the wallet.

Without an API it is easy to check the balance, you only need Electrum.

!!Always make sure that you use the direct links to the downloads!!

STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS
1. You need Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Python on your Computer
3. Start the Terminal or PowerShell
4. Navigate to folder and install all requirements:
   pip install ecdsa base58 requests tqdm pycryptodome
   !! If command doesn't work, install all dependencies one by one.
5. Open file "search.py" with editor (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
   !IMPORTANT! Scroll to line 84 and adjust the path and name of your wordlist.
   !OPTIONAL! Adjust the link for the Blockchain.info API, script also works without API.
6. Now start the script with "python search.py" and wait two minutes.
   Four "txt" files are created: address.txt, addressprivkey.txt, found.txt, privatekeys.txt
   - File address.txt: Contains only the public Bitcoin addresses
   - File addressprivkey.txt: Contains public addresses and the corresponding private key
   - File found.txt: If Blockchain.info API is available, then found addresses & private keys are stored here
   - File privatekeys.txt: Contains only the private keys
   
CHECK BALANCE WITHOUT BLOCKCHAIN.INFO API
1. It's easy, download the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet: https://electrum.org/#download
2. Install the wallet and start it!
3. Then click "Next" and select the option "Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys".
4. Insert the private keys or addresses (bulk possible!) and click next.
5. Set a password and click finish.
Now the wallet is updated and with luck there will be funds on the address.

TIPS:
- Do not add more than 150 private keys at once, otherwise synchronization will take a very long time.
- You can add 10,000+ addresses, synchronization is very fast and when you have found credit, 
  use the search function in the "addressprivkey.text" file and look for the private key 
  and import only this one key.
- You can use any wordlist, it is important to adjust the path and the name of the wordlist or simply 
  rename your wordlist to "rockyou.txt".
- When entering the path, please note thspelling: C:\\important\\always\\two\\backslash.txt
